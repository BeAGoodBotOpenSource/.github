## Be a Good Bot (BGB) - AI Club ðŸ‘‹ 
## Open-source Edition

A Harvard/MIT student collaborative aiming to release a social impact AI application every Wednesday. We are also alumni, founders, innovators, and AI enthusiasts. 


Building a community and hacking every Wednesday wasn't easy, especially when members also had full-time jobs, research, or classes to attend. We believe that by applying the lessons we learned, you can achieve this too.

Be A Good Bot (BGB) started as a single idea and grew to include 60+ members from Harvard, MIT, and beyond. Although we built 10 apps, one of them made it all worthwhileâ€”this one went on to become a full startup!

Technical lessons learned:
- Use AI to build the UI. E.g., Aider AI, gpt-engineer, or Cursor IDE
- CICD for test/prod builds: dockerize and Render is a match in heaven
- AI APIs: if your supplemental model is not better, just call an API
- Fastest dev stack: React + Python + Flask
- Expect ~50% of your apps to be eaten by ChatGPT
- Host all apps with 1 central server for dev speed, then decouple
- Simplify AI Chat Bot dev via Flowise + Pinecone
- Building a fully automated edTech video app takes more than a week- dare yourself to try it, but youâ€™ve been warned

Business lessons learned:
- Build and communicate an inspiring mission
- Time and team morale are your currency
- $2k of MRR for 10 apps is not realistic. Expect only 10% or less to succeed 
- Have a budget for dinners. Hacking needs fuel 
- Work more than talking
- Demo + presentations should last no longer than 5 minutes
- Separating technical and business teams makes them more productive

Marketing lessons learned:
- Word-of-mouth marketing beats any campaign
- Not all apps need marketing, aim for quality over quantity
- Only promote if 1) 10x+ valuable 2) 2x+ high-quality of competition
- IG reels video templates expedite marketing 10x
- Consistency when posting is key to increase % of viral posts
- Run experiments, donâ€™t expect the target market to translate to sales directly

Thank you for your interest in our little experiment. Together, we can push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with AI ðŸš€
